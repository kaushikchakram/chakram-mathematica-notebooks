# chakram-mathematica-notebooks

## This repository contains some Mathematica notebooks that I have produced over the years that are useful.

### The file contents are as follows:
+ A folder named `checking_calculations`: it consists of mathematica noteooks and the corresponding .pdf file of that mathematica notebook. I wrote these notebooks to check that my calulations were indeed correct for some assignments in a quantum mechanics course during my undergraduate studies.
+ Two other important files: `Kaushik Chakram_Mathematica Notebook.nb` and the corresponding `Kaushik Chakram_Mathematica Notebook.pdf` .pdf file.
+  The main purpose of this `Kaushik Chakram_Mathematica Notebook.nb` notebook is to document features of Mathematica.
+  This is done such that it serves as a how-to guide for the user. It contains several examples of in-built functions in Mathematica that can be used for plotting, integration, series expansions etc.
